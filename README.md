## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Design and create a MySQL database called PoisedPMS. Assume that each project can only be assigned to one Structural Engineer. Each project will also only have one Project Manager, one Architect and one customer.

Submit the following:

○ An ERD that shows the relationships between the tables in your database.(4)

○ Screenshots of your console that show how each table was created.(1)

● Add at least two rows of data to each table in the database. Submit screenshots of your console that show how data is added to the tables.(5)

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Using the JDBC, write a java program with the functionality to:

○ Capture information about new projects and add these to the database.(5)

○ Update information about existing projects.(2)

○ Delete data about projects and people associated with them.(2)

○ Finalise existing projects - when finalised the project should be marked as “finalised” and the completion date should be added.(4)

○ Find all projects that still need to be completed from the database.(1)

○ Find all projects that are past the due date from the database.(3)

○ Find and select a project by entering either the project number or project name.(3)

● Besides meeting the above criteria, you should also do the following:

○ Remove all errors from your code. Take extra care to detect and remove all logical and runtime errors.

○ Document your code. Adhere to the style guide found here(https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#styleguide).

○ Use Javadoc to generate API documentation from documentation comments for your program.

○ Create a Readme file for this project.(5)
